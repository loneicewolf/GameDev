# PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
- docs help me to get a overview
- GPT Helps me a bit to begin
- right now i think i enjoy it[godot] actually cuz, it's so simple, button,menu,etc. < really nice!
- now i got into a button and i have no audio file, so I copied /usr/share/sounds OR /usr/share/audio FILES, and then, it only needed mp3 so..
  - https://askubuntu.com/questions/442997/how-can-i-convert-audio-from-ogg-to-mp3
  - `ffmpeg -i usr_share_freedesktop_stereo_bell.oga usr_share_freedesktop_stereo_bell.mp3` this should work ig
  - did it work in godot? [Y/N]: Yes
  - some simple problems like, "cant attach node cuz no script or whatever > make new script etc and try again, yep works!" and "no scene selected, select this one? yep."

  - plays the `ffmpeg -i usr_share_freedesktop_stereo_bell.oga usr_share_freedesktop_stereo_bell.mp3`  if button pressed

  # so far so good!
