FUTURE TODO
I want to make a world out of pre-made pieces, but its tiring to place them one by one all the time, I wonder if there's some way to use *pre made pieces* and then *make a random proc.generation* in godot?
..like a dungeon crawl?

i mean obviously not minecraft but like
just, to narrow down the possibilities by,,say, WELL - 99% PERCENT - by using just a few pre-made parts in blender?
say, room,hallway,corridor,junctions,etc
all i have to do is basically 3 things?

1) random generation easy to do with seeds(which could be minecraft LIKE since a seed is deterministic[basically the same all the time]) and so on, could be a fun way to exploit weak randomness as well!
2) the actual algo, and
3) the smart "how to place say, a opening of a room, close and in the right way to a corridor so they 'match' so, corridor=connect=to=room?"
